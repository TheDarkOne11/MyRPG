MY TODO LIST:

Test of the screen using makeshift moving player.		DONE

Fill gameMap in Level - gameMap is the 2-dimensional vector of MyObjects
	- need class that helps me choose descendants of MyObject

Add user input - for the player (moving for testing)	DONE
	1/ have seperate class for user input?
	2/ have user inputs in Game and Level classes?

Make player camera - window centralized around player.
Test of the camera using simple array of chars - check how well it works when player is moving.
	- check with gameMap bigger than the screen
	- check if gameMap is printed properly when moving
