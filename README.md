# MyRPG
My seminar work for PA2, FIT 2017.

Game:
2D RPG game using Ncurses.
Turn-based. Player goes through dungeon floors, collects items and kills enemies.
Game continues until the player dies.

Special things:
  - map layouts specified in a file
  - player, items, enemies... spawn randomly in the chosen map
  - simple game loading/ saving
