MY TODO LIST:

Test of the screen using makeshift player.
Complete main.cpp timer.
Complete Game update and paint methods (makeshift for testing, using simple char array)
Add user input for the player (moving for testing).
Make player camera - window centralized around player.
Test of the camera using simple array of chars - check how well it works when player is moving.
